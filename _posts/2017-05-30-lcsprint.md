title: Library Carpentry sprint, 1-2 June, 2017
---

The Library Carpentry sprint is part of the [2017 Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/), which will take place worldwide on 1-2 June, 2017.

Join us to be part of it!

Sprint hashtag: **#lc2017**
Library Carpentry Twitter handle: [**@LibCarpentry**](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry)

Our sprint entry on [Mozilla Pulse](https://www.mozillapulse.org/entry/253).

We will use the sprint to amend, update, and extend the existing Library Carpentry lessons and get draft lessons on SQL, Python, web scraping, and other topics into final shape for launch. We welcome contributions from librarians, archivists, information professionals, digital humanities researchers ... anyone who wants to contribute to building the lessons and this burgeoning community.

**How will the sprint work?**
We will use our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry) and this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry) to organise work during the 2-day sprint. Join the chatroom at any time using your GitHub username or your Twitter handle. Our current draft plan of work is at https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/librarycarpentry.github.io/issues/23#issuecomment-290058114 and there is information in the [README](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/blob/master/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) files in the repository.

These files list all the work we are hoping to do so that people can start working straightaway. There will be designated people available to answer questions at most times during the sprint. We will use the chatroom to wrangle those questions and clarifications, and also you will be able to ask questions via scheduled video calls (which we will also use for networking). If you are not sure about something, post a question in the chatroom (directed to someone in particular, if need be) and someone will get back to you.

**How the sprint will be organised**

- There are a number of dedicated sites, all of which will start working at different times as the sun moves around the globe. People will also be working remotely. Sites will organise their own work and report back on how things are going during video calls, via the chatroom, or through the daily handovers.
- Handovers will take place at the end of the work day in the southern hemisphere and at the beginning of the new work day there. 
- Sprinters can work on whatever lesson they like. If you are not a coder, maybe pair up with someone else and work through a lesson of your choice. Then raise issues, suggest changes, or propose scenarios or workflows you would like to see addressed. We are interested as much in ideas as in new code. Our aim is to make the lessons as useful and as relevant as possible to librarians and other information workers. If you have a dataset to suggest, that is also useful.
- You can just network during the sprint if you like. Most of the Library Carpentry community will be taking part in this sprint at different times. Use the sprint to meet these people virtually and talk about running a workshop, hosting a workshop, or other issues that have cropped upfor you or your institution or country.
- Our [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) is another tool we will use for organising the work of the sprint. Dedicated etherpads will be created for each lesson being worked on - they will be listed on this pad. 
- Links to video calls will also be posted on the etherpad, with the scheduled times.
- Since people are working both at dedicated sites (see the etherpad for locations) and remotely, we will touch base regularly so everyone feels part of it. You can use the chatroom at any time to say in touch, post updates or ask questions.
- Tweet about the event using the handle @LibCarpentry and the hashtag #lc20167 - photos are good too. It would be great to have photos of each site's people so we can do a storify later of how the sprint went.

**What you can do**
Work on existing lessons by
- **submitting pull requests** (keep each pull request small - one or two changes only per PR - to make them easier to manage for maintainers)
- **raising issues** for discussion/amendment against specific lessons using the *Issues* tab for each lesson
- **chatting with others** in the chatroom or via the daily catchups and video calls.

**Lesson Maintainers**

This is a list of people who maintain each Library Carpentry lesson. If you are editing a lesson, be sure to check in with them throughout the sprint. Volunteers to help maintain a lesson after the sprint are always welcome!
