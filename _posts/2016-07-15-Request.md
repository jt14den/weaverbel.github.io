If you want a Software Carpentry workshop at your institution, you can request 
one [here](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/). 

Think you might want a [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) one instead? 
Here is all the [info you need](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/).

Interested in a Library Carpentry course? Ping me, or lob your enquiry into our [chat room](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry).
