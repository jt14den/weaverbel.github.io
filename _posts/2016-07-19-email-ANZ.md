title: Stay in touch via the mailing list

There is a low-traffic email list you can join to stay in touch with Australian and New Zealand 
Software Carpentry activities.

Information about joining is [here](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/aus-nz).

It is a good way to find local instructors and helpers for workshops, or to raise issues or ask questions.

You can follow the [Software Carpentry blog](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/) 
for other Software Carpentry news.
