title: Australian and New Zealand Mailing List

## Stay in touch via email

There is a mailing list for people who want to keep track of Software Carpentry activities and news in
 Australia and New Zealand.
 
 All the info on how to join is [here](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/aus-nz). It is a very low traffic list, 
 but worth joining to meet other instructors and helpers locally, and to help you organise workshops.
 
 You can also ask for help and advice about workshops.
 
 You can also follow the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) [blog](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/).
